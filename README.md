# Bruce Lee Tribute Page

For freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Project, Build a Tribute Page, I decided to create one for Jun Fan Lee, who is more popularly known as Bruce Lee.  Basic HTML and CSS were used to create this project.

I used CodePen to host the tribute page, and you can access the content here: https://codepen.io/jarrenls/full/XgeGMY/.
